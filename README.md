# Multi-Cloud Agnostic Automation Tools Analysis

## 1. Identified Automation Product Offerings

The following automation tools were identified for analysis based on their multi-cloud compatibility and capabilities:

1. **Terraform Enterprise** (by HashiCorp)
2. **Terragrunt** (wrapper for Terraform)
3. **Pulumi**
4. **Crossplane**
5. **Cloudify**
6. **Ansible with Cloud Modules**
7. **Spacelift**

## 2. Analysis Criteria
To evaluate these tools, the following criteria were used:

1. **Multi-Cloud Support** – Ability to provision infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Capabilities** – Support for defining infrastructure declaratively.
3. **State Management** – Handling of infrastructure state and drift detection.
4. **Collaboration & Governance** – Features enabling teamwork, role-based access control (RBAC), and policy enforcement.
5. **Ease of Use & Learning Curve** – Complexity of setup, learning requirements, and usability.
6. **Extensibility & Integrations** – Support for third-party integrations, extensibility with plugins/modules.
7. **Cost & Licensing** – Open-source vs. enterprise pricing models.

## 5. Recommendations

### **Best for Enterprise Governance & Compliance:**
**Terraform Enterprise** – Offers advanced governance, collaboration, and policy enforcement but comes at a high cost.

### **Best for Teams Using Terraform:**
**Terragrunt** – Simplifies and enhances Terraform workflows while remaining free and lightweight.

### **Best for Developers Who Prefer Coding over HCL:**
**Pulumi** – Allows defining infrastructure using programming languages, making it easier for developers.

### **Best Kubernetes-Native Approach:**
**Crossplane** – Ideal for Kubernetes-heavy environments with declarative multi-cloud automation.

### **Best for Simplicity & Agentless Automation:**
**Ansible with Cloud Modules** – Easy to start with but lacks robust state management.

### **Best for Advanced IaC Workflow Automation:**
**Spacelift** – Great for managing Terraform, Pulumi, and other IaC tools with security and automation in mind.

### **Overall Recommendation:**
For most organizations, **Terraform Enterprise** or **Pulumi** would be the best choice for structured multi-cloud automation, while **Terragrunt** remains an excellent lightweight alternative for Terraform users. If Kubernetes-native automation is a priority, **Crossplane** is worth considering.
